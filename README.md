# RX2024_SQL
Hi This is Jeff From LP,

I hope you enjoyed my session at RX24.  In this repo you will find the slide deck from the conference along with the demo scripts and some various example scripts you might find useful or interesting.  I will try to add to it from time to time as I come across things that may be of interest to the community.  Feel free to make suggestions or submit pull requests.

NOTE: All code files here are provided AS-IS with no warranty.  These are custom SQL Scripts to be used as examples or demos and could damage or destroy data in your database.  If you are unsure what any of these scripts might do, you should move along without executing any of them.  Use at your own risk!
